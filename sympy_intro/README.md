# Python Scripts Repository

This repository contains multiple Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, data types, functions, and GitHub workflow.

## Objective of Each Script

1. **datatypes.py**
   - Demonstrates different data types in Python (int, float, complex, list, tuple, dict, set, and bool).
   - Prints the type of each variable.
   - Converts integers to floats and vice versa.

2. **control_structures.py**
   - Asks the user for an integer and determines if it's even or odd.
   - Generates a list of even numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
   - Uses a while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.
   - Implements a function to classify numbers as even or odd.

3. **modular_functions.py**
   - Defines a function `calculate_area(shape, dimension1, dimension2=0)` that calculates the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle.
   - Uses math operations including `math.pi` for circles.
   - Calls the function multiple times to test different shapes.

## How to Run the Scripts

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x must be installed on your system.
- Clone this repository using:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  cd your-repo
  ```

### Running the Scripts
   To run the scripts use the python command with the name of the script.
   example: python modular_functions.py

## What I Learned From This Exercise
- How to use different data types in Python effectively.
- Implementing control structures such as loops and conditionals.
- Writing modular functions for better code reuse.
- Using Git and GitHub for collaboration.
